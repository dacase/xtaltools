\begin_layout Standard
Simulations of biomolecular crystals are in principle no different than
 any of the simulations that AMBER does in periodic boundary conditions.
 However, the setup of these systems is not trivial and probably cannot
 be accomplished with the LEaP software.
 Of principal importance are the construction of the solvent conditions
 (packing precise amounts of multiple solvent species into the simulation
 cell), and tailoring the unit cell dimensions to accommodate the inherently
 periodic nature of the system.
 The LEaP software, designed to construct simulations of molecules in solution,
 will overlay a pre-equilibrated solvent mask over the (biomolecular) solute,
 tile that mask throughout the simulation cell, and then prune solvent residues
 which clash with the solute.
 The result of this procedure is a system which will likely contract under
 constant pressure dynamics as the pruning process has left vacuum bubbles
 at the solute:solvent interface.
 Simulations of biomolecular crystals require that the simulation cell begin
 at a size corresponding to the crystallographic unit cell, and deviate
 very little from that size over the course of equilibration and onset of
 constant pressure dynamics.
 This demands a different strategy for placing solvent in the simulation
 cell.
 Four programs in the 
\emph on
AmberTools
\emph default
 release are designed to accomplish this.
 An example of their use in given in a web-based tutorial at 
\emph on
https://ambermd.org/tutorials/advanced/tutorial13/XtalTutor1.html 
\emph default
.
 A recent (2018) review of crystal simulations is also worth consulting.

UnitCell
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A macromolecular crystal contains many repeating unit cells which stack
 like blocks in three dimensional space just as simulation cells do in periodic
 boundary conditions.
 Each unit cell, in turn, may contain multiple symmetry-related clusters
 of atoms.
 A PDB file contains one set of coordinates for the irreducible unit of
 the crystal, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

asymmetric unit,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and also information about the crystal space group and unit cell dimensions.
 The 
\emph on
UnitCell
\emph default
 program reads PDB files, seeking the SMTRY records within the REMARKs to
 enumerate the rotation and translation operations which may be applied
 to the coordinates given in the PDB file to reconstruct one complete unit
 cell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Usage of the 
\shape italic
UnitCell
\shape default
 program is as follows.
 The simple command rests on a critical assumption, that the PDB file contains
 an accurate CRYST1 record and that the REMARK 290 SMTRY records provide
 its space group symmetry operations.

PropPDB
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simulations in periodic boundary conditions require a minimum unit cell
 size: the simulation cell must be able to enclose a sphere of at least
 the nonbonded direct space cutoff radius plus a small buffer region for
 nonbonded pairlist updates.
 Many biomolecular crystal unit cells come in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shoebox
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dimensions that may have one very short side; many unit cells are also
 not rectangular but triclinic, meaning that the size of the largest sphere
 they can enclose is further reduced.
 The workhorse simulation engine, pmemd.cuda, even requires that the simulation
 cell be at least three times as thick as the cutoff plus some buffer margin
 in order to run safely: for typical sum conditions this thickness is about
 30Ã….
 For these reasons, and perhaps to ensure that the rigid symmetry imposed
 by periodic boundary conditions does not create artifacts (crystallographic
 unit cells are equivalent when averaged over all time and space, but are
 not necessarily identical at any given moment), it may be necessary to
 include multiple unit cells within the simulation cell.
 This is the purpose of the 
\emph on
PropPDB
\emph default
 program: to propagate a unit cell in one or more directions so that the
 complete simulation cell meets minimum size requirements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Drawing on the hypothetical example above, if the unit cell is too small
 we can extend it in the

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
 program handles placement of solvent within a crystal unit cell or supercell
 (as may be created by PropPDB).
 As described in the introduction, the basic strategy is to place solvent
 such that added solvent molecules do not clash with biomolecule solutes,
 but 
\shape italic
may
\shape default
 clash with one another initially.
 This compromise is necessary because enough solvent must be added to the
 system to ensure that the correct unit cell dimensions are maintained in
 the long run, but it is not acceptable to place solvent within the interior
 of a biomolecule where it might not belong and never escape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
 program takes a PDB file providing the coordinates of a complete biomolecular
 unit cell or supercell (argument -c), the dimensions by which that supercell
 repeats in space (the unit cell dimensions are taken from the CRYST1 record
 of this file), a PDB file describing the solvent residue to add (argument
 -a), and the number of copies of that solvent molecule to add (argument
 -na).
 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
 inherently assumes that the biomolecular unit cell it is initially presented
 may contain some amount of solvent already, and according to the AMBER
 convention of listing macromolecular solute atoms first and solvent last
 assumes that the first -P atoms in the file are the protein (or biomolecule).
 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
 will then color a very fine grid 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

black
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if the grid point is within a certain distance of a biomolecular atom (argument
 -RP, default 5.0Ã…) or other solvent atom (argument -RW, default 1.0Ã…); the
 grid is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

white
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 otherwise (the grid is stored in binary for memory efficiency).
 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
 will the make a copy of the solvent residue and randomly rotate and translate
 it somewhere within the unit cell.
 If all atoms of the solvent residue land on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

white
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 grid voxels, the solvent molecule will become part of the system and the
 grid around the newly added solvent will be blacked out accordingly.
 If the solvent molecule cannot be placed, this process will be repeated
 until a million consecutive failures are encountered, at which point the
 program will terminate.
 If 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
 has not placed the requested number of solvent molecules by the time it
 terminates, the -V option can be used to order the program to recursively
 call itself with progressively smaller solvent buffer distances until all
 the requested solvent can be placed.
 The output of the 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
 program is another PDB named by the -o option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Successful operation of 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
 may take practice.
 If multiple solvent species are required, as is the case with heterogeneous
 crystallization solutions, 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
 may be called repeatedly with each input molecular cell being the previous
 call's output.
 When considering crystal solvation, the order of addition is important!
 It is recommended that rare species, such as trace buffer reagents, be
 added first, with large -RW argument to ensure that they are dispersed
 throughout the available crystal void zones.
 Large solvent species such as MPD (an isohexane diol commonly used in crystalli
zation conditions) should be added second, and with a sufficiently large
 -RW argument that methyl groups and ring systems cannot become interlocked
 (which will likely lead to SHAKE / vlimit errors).
 Small and abundant species such as water should be added last, as they
 can go anywhere that space remains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below is an example of the usage for a hypothetical protein with 5431 atoms
 and a net charge of +6 that is to be neutralized with ammonium sulfate:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
AddToBox -c ExpandedCell.pdb -a Sulfate.pdb -na 18 -RP 3.0 -P 5431 -o System.pdb
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
AddToBox -c System.pdb -a Ammonium.pdb -na 30 -RP 3.0 -P 5431 -o System.pdb
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
AddToBox -c System.pdb -a Water.pdb -na 1089 -RP 3.0 -P 5431 -o System.pdb
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of the -V flag ensures that the desired amounts of each species
 are included.
 The protein clipping radius of 3Ã… is lower than the default, but safe (remember
, this radius stipulates that no solvent atom, regardless of the size of
 the solvent molecule, come within 3Ã… of the protein).
 Note how the original protein PDB file serves as the base for system, but
 thereafter we work with the System.pdb to accumulate more solvent particles.
 Here, the ammonium sulfate serves both to neutralize the system and replicate
 a salty bath, perhaps from a crystallization mother liquor, hence the break
 from the usual 2:1 stoichiometry of ammonium sulfate ions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is likely that the unobservable 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

void
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 regions between biomolecules in most crystals 
\shape italic
do not
\shape default
 contain solvent species in proportion to their abundance in the crystallization
 solutionâ€“the vast majority of these regions are within a few â„«ngstroms
 of some biomolecular surface, and different biomolecular functional groups
 will preferentially interact with some types of solvent over others.
 Also, in many crystals some solvent molecules 
\shape italic
are
\shape default
 observed; in many of these, the amount of solvent observed is such that
 it would be impossible to pack other species into the unit cell in proportion
 to their abundances in the crystallization fluid.
 In these cases, we recommend estimating the amount of volume that must
 be filled with solvent 
\shape italic
apart from solvent which has already been observed in the crystal
\shape default
, and filling this void with solvent in proportion to the composition of
 the crystallization fluid.
 For example, if a crystal were grown in a 1:1 mole-to-mole water/ethanol
 mixture, and the crystal coordinates as deposited in the PDB contained
 500 water molecules and 3 ethanol molecules, we would use 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
 to add water and ethanol in a 1:1 ratio until the system contained enough
 solvent to maintain the correct volume during equilibrium dynamics at constant
 pressure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, it is difficult to estimate exactly how much solvent will be needed
 to maintain the correct equilibrium volume; the advisable approach is simply
 to make an initial guess and script the setup so that, over multiple runs
 and reconstructions, the correct system composition can be found.
 We recommend matching the equilibrium unit cell volume to within 0.3% to
 keep this simulation parameter within the error of most crystallographic
 measurements.
 While errors of 0.5-1% will show up quickly after constant pressure dynamics
 begin, a 10 to 20ns simulation may be needed to ensure that the correct
 equilibrium volume has been achieved.

After the complex process of adding solvent, the LEaP program may be used
 to produce a topology and initial set of coordinates based on the PDB file
 produced by 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
.
 By using the 
\shape italic
SetBox
\shape default
 command, LEaP will create a periodic system without adding any more solvent
 on its own.
 The only problem with using LEaP at this point is that the program will
 fail to realize that the system 
\shape italic
does
\shape default
 tile in three dimensions if only the box dimensions are set properly.
 If visualized, the output of UnitCell / PropPDB will likely look jagged,
 but the output of 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
, containing lots of added water, will make it obvious how parts of biomolecules
 jutting out one face of the box fit neatly into open spaces on an opposite
 face.
 The topology produced by LEaP needs no editing; only the last line of the
 coordinates does.
 This can be done manually, but the 
\emph on
ChBox
\emph default
 program automates the process, taking the same coordinates supplied to
 AddToBox and grafting them into the input coordinates file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The program is even unnecessary in the case of orthorhombic (rectangular)
 unit cells, as this the tleap command will substitute:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
set [unit] box { <x> <y> <z> }
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For cells that do not have only 90-degree box angles, 
\shape italic
ChBox
\shape default
 will do the trick.
